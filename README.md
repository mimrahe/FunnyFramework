# FunnyFramework
this is a very simple php framework I wrote it last year in 2015/4
there is no need to any documentation for the framework because FunnyFramework is very simple and clear
this version of FunnyFramework is 0.09 and has many weakness in coding and strategy and need for improvements!
anyone has permissions for using and editing FunnyFramwork!
# Anything will be done if I dont fear! Fear is worth than Dead!
